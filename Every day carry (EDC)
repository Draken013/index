These items are what I normally carry on a daily basis. Your needs may be vastly different, but I emphasize functionality and practicality over fashion.

CLOTHING:
I tend to stick with the "gray man" look: One generally solid color (Black, in my case).
T-shirt
Cargo pants
Cell phone belt case
Flight jacket (CWU-45P style)

STORAGE PACK:
My main backpack is the NOOLA Military Tactical Backpack Molle Bag Army Assault Pack Detachable Rucksack. The backpack part alone has a 50L capacity, and it comes with a small bottle holder, a small dump pouch, and a fanny pack with detatchable belt. That belt is what I use for other carry stuff.

When it's impractical for me to use my backpack, I put the fanny pack's belt on with two pouches, a large bottle holder, and my sunglass case.

One of my pouches I never leave home without is a Mission Darkness Dry Shield MOLLE Faraday Pouch to keep specific devices away from Bluetooth beacons if I ever enter a major retailer like Target or Walmart.
