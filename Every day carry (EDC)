These items are what I normally carry on a daily basis. Your needs may be vastly different, but I emphasize functionality and practicality over fashion.

CLOTHING:
I tend to stick with the "gray man" look: One generally solid color (Black, in my case).
T-shirt
Cargo pants
Boots (usually Bates with the side zipper)
Cell phone belt case
Flight jacket (CWU-45P style)
MOLLE (MOdular Lightweight Load-carrying Equipment) backpack/pouches

STORAGE PACK:
My main backpack is the NOOLA Military Tactical MOLLE Backpack (solid black). The backpack part alone has a 50L capacity, and it comes with a small bottle holder, a small dump pouch, and a fanny pack with detatchable belt. That belt is what I use for other carry stuff. If you're going to get a backpack, I recommend getting something MOLLE compatible, and I really recommend the aforementioned one. I also recommend getting extra pouches, like the Mission Darkness Dry Shield MOLLE Faraday Pouch. It's a great way to store your electronics if you're going into a major retailer that uses tracking devices to monitor your cell phone and bombard you with ads. Another couple of things I recommend getting are polymer straps and D-rings. Both are compatible with the MOLLE system and can attach more stuff to your backpack.

When it's impractical for me to use my backpack, I put the fanny pack's belt on with a large bottle holder and a separate dump pouch.
