The basics

You're probably tired of seeing "your password needs 1 upper case character, 1 number, and 1 special character."

You're probably tired of seeing your crazy uncle sharing Qanon bullshit on Facebook.

This is going to be a guide on how to navigate an increasingly hostile internet, and why you should care about personal privacy and security, but let's get a few things straight first.

First and foremost, using phones to browse the internet is far safer than using computers, and even then that's just Android and iPhone. This is because both Android and iOS/iPadOS run on what's known as "the principle of least privilege." What this means is that apps are only given the permissions you allow them to have. In other words, you can prevent certain apps from even accessing the internet if you so choose. I'll go more into detail about this in Android vs iPhone.

Computers, on the other hand, don't have such a thing. On Windows especially, programs are designed to just run at full speed without any regard to what kind of files it reads at what level. Again, it's safer to browse the internet on your phone than it is on your computer.

The above is just a taste of what's to come.
